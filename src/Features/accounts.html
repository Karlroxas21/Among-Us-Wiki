                        names, inappropriate chat, cheating/hacking, and harassment/misconduct. Consequences can range
                        from
                        temporary to permanent bans (including alternate accounts).</li>

                    <li>Accounts are required to change the player's display name. If the player does not create an
                        account,
                        there is a button that can be used to randomize the player's display name.</li>

                        the
                        minimum age), they will need a parent/guardian's permission to create an account.</li>

                        the
                        Online button inaccessible. Additionally, the accounts tab has a colored outline that changes

                        </li>
                        <li>Gray means that the player is playing offline.</li>

                    <li>In version 2021.11.9, the accounts system was updated again to allow one account to be shared
                        across
                        multiple devices. This allows cosmetics and EXP obtained on one device to carry over to another
                        and
                        back
                        again. Accounts may be linked through Innersloth's website.</li>

                        <li>In version 2022.3.29, account linking was temporarily disabled to make sure Friends List
                            work

                <p>Accounts were confirmed on September 23, 2020, in a devlog by Innersloth as one of the new features
                    that
                    will
                    be implemented into Among Us after the cancellation of the game's sequel, Among Us 2. They stated
                    that a
                    friends system would also be added.<br><br>
                    On November 3, 2020, moderation features were announced in the in-game announcements. The release
                    date
                    of
                    this feature was revealed to be sometime during December 2020. However, as of early 2021, the update
                    has
                    still not released.<br><br>
                    On November 19, 2020, the Among Us Twitter account made a post stating that moderation features are
                    a
                    top
                    priority. They said, "We want our space to be welcoming & respectful, so this is our first step in
                    sabotaging the toxicity and hacking."<br><br>
                    An external development team is working on the accounts system, though it has not been confirmed who
                    the
                    team is.<br><br>
                    On March 18, 2021, the first version of accounts was confirmed to be releasing on March 31, 2021,
                    alongside
                    The Airship and released on schedule.
