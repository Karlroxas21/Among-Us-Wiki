                    <li>Players are able to report if someone in the game is acting inappropriately, including:
                        inappropriate
                        names, inappropriate chat, cheating/hacking, and harassment/misconduct. Consequences can range
                        from
                        temporary to permanent bans (including alternate accounts).</li>
                    <li>Accessing Free Chat requires an account (without it the only chat option is Quick Chat).</li>
                    <li>Accounts are required to change the player's display name. If the player does not create an
                        account,
                        there is a button that can be used to randomize the player's display name.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Usernames are not exclusive. Multiple people can have the same username.</li>
                        <li>If multiple players with the same username join the same lobby, each player with a matching
                            username
                            after the first to join is numbered next to their name until they leave the game.</li>

                        the
                        minimum age), they will need a parent/guardian's permission to create an account.</li>
                    <li>Without an account the player can still play via Guest Mode which has social features (only
                        Quick

                    <li>In version 2022.3.29, the accounts system was updated to integrate a Friends List.</li>
                    <li>In version 2021.4.12, the accounts system was updated to add an option to go offline, which
                        makes
                        the
                        Online button inaccessible. Additionally, the accounts tab has a colored outline that changes
                        based
                        on
                        the player's status:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Green means that the player is logged into their account.</li>
                        <li>Yellow means that the player is not logged into their account and is playing as a guest.
                        </li>
                        <li>Gray means that the player is playing offline.</li>
                        <li>Blue means that the player is pending confirmation from their parent or guardian to have
                            access
                            to a

                    </ul>
                    <li>In version 2021.11.9, the accounts system was updated again to allow one account to be shared
                        across
                        multiple devices. This allows cosmetics and EXP obtained on one device to carry over to another
                        and
                        back
                        again. Accounts may be linked through Innersloth's website.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The process of linking a main account to another account overwrites any and all progress
                            from
                            the
                            other account to make way for the main one.</li>
                        <li>Account linking is unavailable on the Nintendo Switch edition and the PlayStation edition.
                        </li>
                        <li>In version 2022.3.29, account linking was temporarily disabled to make sure Friends List
                            work
                            properly.</li>

                <hr>
                <p>Accounts were confirmed on September 23, 2020, in a devlog by Innersloth as one of the new features
                    that
                    will
                    be implemented into Among Us after the cancellation of the game's sequel, Among Us 2. They stated
                    that a
                    friends system would also be added.<br><br>
                    On November 3, 2020, moderation features were announced in the in-game announcements. The release
                    date
                    of
                    this feature was revealed to be sometime during December 2020. However, as of early 2021, the update
                    has
                    still not released.<br><br>
                    On November 19, 2020, the Among Us Twitter account made a post stating that moderation features are
                    a
                    top
                    priority. They said, "We want our space to be welcoming & respectful, so this is our first step in
                    sabotaging the toxicity and hacking."<br><br>
                    An external development team is working on the accounts system, though it has not been confirmed who
                    the
                    team is.<br><br>
                    On March 18, 2021, the first version of accounts was confirmed to be releasing on March 31, 2021,
                    alongside
                    The Airship and released on schedule.
