                    <p>Colors change the appearance of the characters in Among Us. Only one character can have each
                        color in the same lobby.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>Players are able to select between 18 different colors using the wardrobe: Red, Blue, Green,
                        Pink, Orange, Yellow, Black, White, Purple, Brown, Cyan, Lime, Maroon, Rose, Banana, Gray, Tan
                        and Coral. The player's selected color does not directly affect gameplay, and only directly
                        affects the player's in-game appearance. The only exception was Fortegreen, who is not
                        legitimately playable in-game and causes numerous bugs when played as. Each color also has a
                        unique color ID; for example, Red's is 0, and Gray's is 15. Fortegreen was an exception to this
                        rule, as it occupied all IDs of whole numbers above 11, examples being 12 and 100, though as of
                        version 2021.2.21, Fortegreen's color ID was removed from the code, so it can no longer be
                        accessed by ID. However, it can still be accessed when joining a lobby (appearing as Fortegreen
                        briefly), selecting a color as someone with that color joins, or as a side effect of another
                        bug.</p>

                            <li>On June 10, 2021, during the Summer Game Fest, a color called Banana was confirmed.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Fortegreen and Olive are the only colors that cannot be selected in the wardrobe.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>However, these color IDs result from Fortegreen being Among Us's failsafe color.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Tan is the only color that was temporarily removed from Among Us. During the removal period,
                            it was still officially recognized in the Innersloth Discord server as a custom emoji, and
                            it has since been added back.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Similarly, Cyan was used in a prototype for Among Us, but removed from its original
                                release. It was later added back along with Lime.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>If the player's selected color ID is anything but a whole number, it will be set to a random
                            value between 0 and 17.</li>
                        <li>Some cosmetics change their appearance based on the player's selected color. These cosmetics
                            include the Mini Crewmate hat, Mini Crewmate pet, and We All Float Here.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Two more cosmetics, the Imp-ressive and Batty, have this ability as well, but only if
                                their "Crewcolor" variants are selected. They do not have this ability by default.</li>
                            <li>If the player is playing as Fortegreen, then these cosmetics will take the appearance of
                                Red's.</li>
                            <li>Contrary to popular belief, the player's color does not affect the chances of them being
                                The Impostor.
                            </li>

                    <h1 id="Cosmetics">Cosmetics</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>Cosmetics are items in Among Us used to customize characters. There are five types of cosmetics:
                        hats, skins, nameplates, visor cosmetics, and pets. Hats are worn on players' heads, skins are
                        worn on their bodies, nameplates appear on the player's voting box in meetings, visors are worn
                        on the face, and pets follow the player around until the player is killed by An Impostor or
                        ejected.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Some cosmetics are free and automatically owned by the player, while a variety of other cosmetics
                        can be unlocked by paying in-game currency. Cosmetics can be bought in the shop or inside
                        Cosmicubes, and owned cosmetics can be equipped in the wardrobe.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Cosmetics grant little gameplay advantage and mostly serve the purpose of supporting the
                        developers. However, if someone is An Impostor and is running away or using a vent, people
                        can identify them by a hat or pet because they make the space of their character larger. On the
                        other hand, if someone is a Crewmate, then cosmetics could be used to verify that a player was
                        in a location. Some cosmetics slightly hide the color of the player, which can further confuse
                        other players. Players with different cosmetics also assist colorblind players in telling
                        characters apart.</p>

                        <li>There used to be sprites for unused hats in the game files, including a traffic cone, a
                            drinking cap, a headcrab, and a pot. These hats were either removed or repurposed into
                            officially released hats.</li>
                        <li>Many skins and hats reference Marcus Bromander's Henry Stickmin series.</li>
                        <li>As of version 2020.10.22, cosmetics are visible on the voting screen, and as of version
                            2021.6.30, they are also visible in the chat screen.</li>
                        <li>The Halloween hats can be unlocked before or after Halloween by setting the device's time to
                            October.</li>

                            military suit.</li>
                        <li>When the kill animation is displayed, a few hats have changes, such as the We All Float Here
                            popping.</li>
                        <li>The cosmetics worn on the players are mirrored if the player is facing the opposite
                            direction. There are some exceptions to this, such as the Right Hand Man: Reborn.</li>
