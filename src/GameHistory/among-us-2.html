            <p id="short-desc">Among Us 2 was the planned sequel to Among Us by Innersloth announced 
                in August 2020. However, on September 23, 2020, only a little more than a month after 
                the original announcement, Innersloth officially announced the cancellation of Among Us 
                2 due to the already existing attention and love of Among Us. However, the content 
                planned for Among Us 2 will still be added in some capacity in an update to Among Us at
                some point in the upcoming future. </p>

            <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
            <p >Among Us 2's gameplay was going to be very similar to the original Among Us,
                 but with upgraded features. Innersloth had planned for the servers to be much larger and 
                 with more players in a match than the 10 player limit in Among Us at the time, with the 
                 sequel reaching for a 12 to 15 player limit with multiple Impostors. Multiple modes and 
                 roles were also planned as well. </p> 
            <hr>
            <h1 id="maps">Maps</h1>   
            <p>No maps were ever confirmed; however, Innersloth had stated not to expect them to copy the 
                first three maps (The Skeld, Mira HQ and Polus) directly over from Among Us. </p>
            <hr>
            <h1 id="trivia">Trivia</h1>
            <p>Unlike Among Us, Among Us 2 would have first released on PC due to taking less time to launch,
                 then later on mobile as the game would have had to go through an approval that could have 
                 taken hours or even days.
