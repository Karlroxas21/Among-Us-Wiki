            <h2>Innersloth</h2>
          </div>
          <p id="short-desc">
           Innersloth is a Redmond, Washington-based video game-development studio,
           most notable for creating the games Among Us and The Henry Stickmin 
           Collection. They create games for Windows, macOS, Nintendo Switch, and 
           mobile devices.</p>
           <p>The developer team persevered when their product did not find success 
               immediately after game release, and waited and adapted their strategy.
               Innersloth faced growing challenges after rapid success and increased 
               popularity in 2020, two years after its release. 
            </p>
            <br><hr><br>
            <h1 id="background">Background</h1>
            <br>
            <h2 id="background-foundation">Foundation</h2>
            <p>Innersloth is structured as a limited liability company. Its staff 
                consists of five programmers, two artists, and a community 
                director. They are based out of Redmond, Washington. The Innersloth 
                team has maintained their focus as an indie game developer. The 
                developers rarely meet in person, preferring remote work. 
                Innersloth was formed by video game developer Marcus Bromander, 
                who goes by the username PuffballsUnited on the gaming website 
                Newgrounds; with his colleague and co-founder Forest Willard.
                All three members of the Innersloth team first met in college at 
                Oregon State University (OSU), and began video game development 
                together after graduation.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Bromander and Willard discovered their video game development skills 
                could help each other, with Bromander's skill game design and artwork 
                complementing Willard's computer programming background. After 
                Willard left his job at Microsoft, they decided to form a joint 
                venture together. Bromander and Willard founded Innersloth as a 
                privately held company in 2015.</p>
                <br>
             <h2 id="background-team">Development Team</h2>   
             <p>Bromander serves as an artist, animator, and game designer for 
                Innersloth. Willard serves as a computer programmer and head of 
                business management for Innersloth. Amy Liu is artist, designer, 
                and animator for Innersloth. Liu was hired as artist for Innersloth 
                shortly after its co-founding by Bromander and Willard. In their
                early development process, the Innersloth team traveled to a video 
                game convention PAX and were inspired by viewing the game Nuclear 
                Throne. During early game design, the Innersloth team engages in 
                creating prototypes with rough images, detailing the art design at 
                a later stage once they worked out the basic game mechanics. In an 
                interview with Kotaku, Bromander explained the strengths and 
                weaknesses behind the developers at Innersloth. Bromander lamented 
                that they were not skilled at promoting their products, telling 
                Kotaku, "We're really bad at marketing." Bromander updates fans on 
                Innersloth developments on his Twitter @PuffBallsUnited, and his 
                YouTube channel where he had 80,000 subscribers in September 2020.</p>
                <br>
            <h2 id="background-growth">Growth and Response</h2>    
            <p>"Kotaku" analyzed the efficiency of the development team at Innersloth, 
                concluding the company succeeded at persevering to improve their product 
                even after an initial stage of failure to achieve popularity in the 
                beginning. Innersloth developers focused on the player experience, 
                over and above microtransactions. The Innersloth developers appreciated 
                the Internet memes based on their work and were driven to create an 
                enjoyable user experience for the players. Willard explained the 
                business model behind Innersloth, "We're a slow-growing company.
                We snowball our way to the top instead of spike and tail like most 
                Steam releases do."  Liu stated she started to follow video game 
                streamers to get more artistic development ideas at Innersloth. 
                By October 2017, all three members of the Innersloth team had begun 
                to devote their efforts full-time to the company. Innersloth faced 
                challenges from rapid success during 2020. After an increase in popularity 
                in 2020, Willard stated Innersloth planned to increase server performance 
                for August 2021. Innersloth experienced problems with hackers attacking 
                their servers in 2020. Innersloth responded by adapting their systems 
                and servers.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Innersloth implemented modifications to allow for moderation in-game 
                    and reporting of problems to the development team.</p>
                <br><hr><br>
            <h1 id="release">Game Release History</h1>  
            <p>Innersloth released its game Dig2China in 2015. It was made available 
                on Google Play and the Apple App Store. In the game, players are able 
                to dig to Asia using an excavator. They can then upgrade their excavator 
                and dig through thirteen layers of the Earth. In-between Dig2China 
                and their next venture, Innersloth experienced multiple failed projects 
                prior to achieving success with their video game development. Some of 
                these failed projects were multiplayer games, which gave the Innersloth 
                team some hesitation with venturing into this medium for their next game. 
                This was followed up by Among Us, first released on June 15, 2018. 
                This game was not successful upon initial release in 2018 and failed 
                to become popular after its launch. However, it gained popularity for 
                Innersloth in 2020, after increased usage by Twitch streamers and YouTubers 
                including Sodapoppin, xQc, Shroud, Ninja, Markiplier, Jacksepticeye and 
                PewDiePie.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A report by Sensor Tower noted, "Innersloth's [game] was a breakaway hit, 
                    reaching No. 1 among the top downloaded games of 3Q20." Associated Press 
                    confirmed this, reporting it was number one on their list of top iPhone 
                    and iPad apps. By October 2020, the game had been downloaded over 
                    100 million times. Innersloth was not prepared for the level of interest 
                    they received from this game, and they altered their video game 
                    development plans accordingly. They originally had planned a release of 
                    an Among Us sequel titled Among Us 2, with new features including 
                    playability across multiple devices and increased capacity for the surge 
                    in the number of players using their systems. Innersloth 
                    canceled their efforts at this initiative in order to focus on 
                    maintaining and improving the original game in the face of sudden rising 
                    popularity. Innersloth released their game The Henry Stickmin Collection 
                    on August 7, 2020, and the game was made available via macOS and PC 
                    versions.</p>
                <br>   
                <p>The Henry Stickmin Collection is a remaster of some of Bromander's previous 
                    flash games, along with a 6th and final installment, and involves control 
                    of a protagonist character assigned special missions including 
                    infiltrating an airship, stealing diamonds, escaping from prison, 
                    and committing bank robberies. GameCrate called it the "indie game 
                    of the month"; and it was reviewed favorably by PC Gamer, and YouTuber 
                    Markiplier.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Among Us was not always named "Among Us". The game was originally named 
                    "Space Mafia." Users have discovered this after going into the game's 
                    files on Android, and seeing the game was internally named "SpaceMafia" 
                    rather than "Among Us". </p>
