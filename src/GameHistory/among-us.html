            Among Us (stylized in the Apple App Store as Among Us!) is an online
            multiplayer science-fiction/social deduction murder mystery game
            created by Innersloth that runs on the Unity Game Engine. It was
            first released on June 15, 2018, for Android and iOS - and was later
            released on Steam on August 18, 2018. On December 15, 2020, a
            Nintendo Switch edition was released, which is available on the
            console's Nintendo eShop. On December 14, 2021, Xbox and PlayStation
            editions were released for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4,
            and PlayStation 5. The game is set on one of four locations; a
            spaceship, above-earth base, planet base, or a Henry-Stickmin-themed
            Airship which contains a group of crew members, among which are up
            to three Impostors who have to Sabotage the ship/base/planet and
            kill off the Crew. Crewmates have to complete their chosen tasks,
            report bodies of other Crewmates who are killed, and initiate
            emergency meetings if they witness another player doing something
            incriminating or suspicious. By 2020, Among Us was considered by
            Innersloth to be a complete game, and as of June 11, 2020, MIRA HQ
            and Polus, which were previously paid for, were released for free
            for players playing both on Windows and Android/iOS/iPadOS to host.
            The game gained an increase in popularity in 2020 due to famous
            Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing it. A sequel, titled Among Us
            2, was announced by Innersloth on August 18, 2020, and was scheduled
            to be available by 2021 but was canceled in September. Work will
            instead improve the original game due to the unexpected popularity
            of the original Among Us. Also, many forms of merchandise, such as
            T-shirts and toys, have been announced and launched.

          <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
          <p>
            Among Us can either take place on a spaceship in outer space, a
            building high in the Earth's atmosphere, an alien planet, or an
            airship. There are two types of roles: The Impostors and the
            Crewmates. There can be a total of 15 players in an online game,
            with up to three Impostors. The Impostors' objective is to eliminate
            players and Sabotage using either aggressive, defensive, or passive
            tactics before the Crewmates complete all of their tasks or discover
            everyone's true identity. The Crewmates' objective is to complete
            all of their tasks, avoid being killed, and figuring out who The
            Impostors are. All tasks are mainly visual and provide a fine
            user-friendly interface for players of all levels and ages.
            Additional roles were released in version 2021.11.9. These new roles
            include Engineer, Scientist, Guardian Angel, and Shapeshifter.

            Among Us is a murder mystery game that can take place either in a
            spaceship named "The Skeld," the headquarters of the company MIRA, a
            research base on the planet Polus, or an Airship. Among the players,
            one to three will be randomly chosen as Impostors, who need to blend
            in and kill the Crewmates. The Crewmates' goal is to complete tasks
            in the form of mini-games, such as fixing wiring, emptying garbage,
            or swiping an ID card, all the while having the goal of finding out
            who The Impostors are and voting them out. Impostors can Sabotage
            the map, which results in either a problem that will cause the Crew
            an inconvenience until fixed (e.g., turning off the lights, which
            affect the vision of the Crew, and messing up the Communications,
            which disables several useful features for the Crew and at the same
            time); or even a severe problem which gives the Crew an important
            task that must be completed under a time limit (such as depletion of
            the oxygen aboard the ship or meltdown of the reactor inside). The
            Impostors' goal is to kill off enough Crewmates for an equal amount
            of Impostors and Crewmates left, which results in a win for The
            Impostors as they theoretically could not be voted out. They are
            able to do this using the aforementioned sabotaging mechanic, though
            their main strategy is to directly murder each and every member one
            by one.

            Players can interact with various useful resources, such as a camera
            system, a sensors system, an administration panel, and a vitality
            machine, which can help crew members catch An Impostor killing a
            player, shapeshifting, or entering a vent. When a player finds a
            dead body, they can report it, which pauses the game and leads to a
            discussion where people can chat to find out who The Impostors are.
            Players can address evidence found with deaths and vote for a person
            they think is An Impostor. The player with the most votes will be
            ejected from the map, and the game will reveal if they were An
            Impostor (if Confirm Ejects is activated). Also, if players are
            unsure of who may be An Impostor, they can skip the vote. If the
            most votes are cast to skip, no one will be ejected. This also
            occurs when the number of votes toward two or more players is equal;
            that is, it is considered a tie.
            <br />
            <br />
            When a player dies, they will become a ghost, who can explore the
            map without colliding with the walls. However, they are not visible
            to the living Crew and can only be seen by other ghosts. Their
            communication system is limited, as they can only interact with
            other dead or ejected players, and they cannot resolve Sabotage. If
            they are a Crewmate, they can still complete tasks. In the same way,
            Impostor ghosts can still Sabotage to disrupt the Crewmates who are
            still alive. Before a game starts, players can configure certain
            game options, such as the number of Impostors, speed, map, kill
            cooldown, among others. They can also customize their character with
            cosmetics, such as colors, skins, hats and pets.

          <h1 id="char-custom">Character Customization</h1>
          <h2 id="char-colors">Colors</h2>
          <p>
            Players can choose from a total of 18 colors. These include Red,
            Blue, Green, Pink, Orange, Yellow, Black, White, Purple, Brown,
            Cyan, Lime, Maroon, Rose, Banana, Gray, Tan, and Coral. There are
            two extra colors (Fortegreen and Olive) that are/were in the game
            but are currently inaccessible by players. Players may also choose
            from different skins, hats and pets to alter cosmetic appearance.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 id="char-skins">Skins</h2>
          <p>
            Skins were added in 2019, including several clothes like police,
            white hat, military, captain, etc. New skins were also added during
            the MIRA HQ release: one for chemists and one for security and the
            Polus map launch: one in cold clothing and the other in mining. The
            skins, including hats, require payment on the mobile version. On
            Windows, they are available after purchasing the game. When the two
            maps were released, each map's exclusive skins were only obtained
            after purchasing it. The skins for both maps were still premium.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 id="char-hats">Hats</h2>
          <p>
            Hats were added in version 2018.10.10 of the game, which included
            several hats for players to customize the character, such as caps
            and masks, Halloween, or Christmas hats. There were new hats in the
            Halloween updates, such as a hockey mask, devil horns, a knife, etc.
            It also received new hats in the special Christmas updates, such as
            a Santa Claus hat and antlers, among other different hats.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In version 2019.5.28, new hats were added, including five hats for
            free and a paid pack of eight hats on mobile and free on computer.
            In version 2020.6.11, new hats were added, such as the balloon hat,
            masks, and tufts among others.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 id="char-cosmetics">Visor Cosmetics</h2>
          <p>
            Visor cosmetics were added in version 2021.11.9, including several
            accessories that are attached to the player's visor. Many new visor
            cosmetics were added, and several previous hats were converted into
            visor cosmetics.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 id="char-pets">Pets</h2>
          <p>
            Added in version 2019.6.12, pets are small creatures that will
            follow the player around. Each pet also has unique animations and
            reactions to its "owner" dying. As of now, there are a total of 11
            different pets available.

          <h2 id="maps-skeld">The Skeld</h2>
          <p>
            The Skeld is the first map of Among Us, also becoming the only free
            map in the game before June 2020. The Skeld is set within a
            turtle-shaped spaceship, which the Crewmates used to travel around
            outer space. Crewmates must complete tasks on the ship and figure
            out who each Impostor is.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 id="maps-mira">Mira HQ</h2>
          <p>
            MIRA HQ is the second map released in Among Us. Unlike the others,
            the map was released as paid content and is set on a sky base,
            rather than a spaceship. The map was officially announced on August
            3, 2019, and was released to the public on August 8, 2019. Unlike
            The Skeld, Impostors can freely roam around vents that are not
            adjacent to a specific vent.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 id="maps-polus">Polus</h2>
          <p>
            Polus is the third map of Among Us, announced on November 1, 2019,
            and released on November 12, 2019. It takes place in a research base
            on the rocky, purple planet of Polus. This map features similarities
            to both The Skeld and MIRA HQ while also having its features. Due to
            being a terrestrial planet, there are no ventilation systems on the
            planet, but rather holes. This map is also currently the second
            largest in Among Us.

          <p>
            The Airship was announced by Innersloth on September 23, 2020, as
            part of the new content added to Among Us after its sequel's
            cancellation, Among Us 2. The map is based on the Toppat Clan
            Airship from Infiltrating the Airship, a Henry Stickmin game also
            developed by Innersloth. It is the fourth and the largest map. It
            contains several new tasks and new mechanics in it, such as ladders
            and moving platforms. It is released on March 31, 2021.

            On January 6, 2020, developers said that "[they] thought it was a
            completed game twice in the past as we came back to add online
            multiplayer and two new maps. But as of the Polus release, we're
            sure that Among Us is a complete game. There are always things that
            people want and things we could potentially add, but Among Us was
            always intended to be a small game, and we are just a team of three
            people with one programmer. We've already added a lot to a small
            game, the difficulty of adding new features and content is now very
            high. You all can see this difficulty in terms of bugs that
            seemingly never get fixed. Adding more things would undoubtedly add
            more bugs. So from now on, we are not adding more to Among Us. There
            will be a few bug-fix-only updates and a plan of price changes, then
            we will let Among Us take its natural course." Then, they intended
            that Among Us servers would run until "at least 2021. Probably
            longer." They also said, "We will announce if we are stopping the
            servers and provide some alternative," If this is the case, the game
            will possibly be able to be self-hosted.

          <h2 id="future-sequel">Canceled Sequel</h2>
          <p>
            On August 18, 2020, Innersloth officially announced that a sequel to
            Among Us, titled Among Us 2, was in development due to the game's
            core sections not being built and adapted to support the addition of
            new content. They also pointed out that "Among Us servers would stay
            alive for as long as it had enough players to start games."[17]
            However, after several long discussions between the developers, they
            announced the sequel would be canceled, with all new features of the
            sequel implemented the original game.

            conference on the same day. The game was ported by PlayEveryWare, an
            external development team. It has also been confirmed to release on
            the Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and the PlayStation 5,

              <li>
                Among Us was inspired by the real-life group social deduction
                game, Mafia, and by the science-fiction horror film The Thing.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The idea for the concept was given by Marcus Bromander, who
                    played Mafia since he was a kid.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                When developing The Skeld, the ship was intended to be always in
                crisis and Impostors could do tasks to mix themselves with the
                Crewmates, however, it was discarded as they found it
                "stressful" and that would affect discussions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Innersloth has planned to launch Among Us for consoles,
                specifically PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but found a problem
                implementing player communication, as text or voice chat seemed
                to be useless.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Despite this issue, Innersloth was able to launch Among Us
                    on Nintendo Switch on December 15, 2020, which is likely
                    because, similarly to a phone, the Switch and Switch Lite
                    both have touch controls in handheld mode, which can be used
                    for typing in the chat.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                MIRA HQ and Polus originally served as additional paid content
                for Among Us until its update on June 11, 2020, when the two
                maps were made permanently free for everyone.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    During this period, these two maps had free weeks for all
                    players to host temporarily.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Currently, the exclusive skins from these maps are paid
                    additional content for the game.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Among Us may have been internally named "Space Mafia" during
                development, as the Play Store's app package name is
                "com.Innersloth.spacemafia."
              </li>
              <li>
                During its history, the game faced, and is facing, several bugs:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Several persons are automatically disconnected due to error.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Some people who become Impostors have the skills of a
                    Crewmate and not those of An Impostor.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                According to Innersloth, Among Us took six months to enter open
                beta and more than six months to exit from open beta.
              </li>
              <li>
                According to Innersloth via Twitter, they settled for the
                Crewmate design relatively quickly.
              </li>
              <li>
                The characters' design is similar to the Morolians from Space
                Channel 5.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Henry Stickmin series, which is also developed by
                Innersloth, is referenced many times in Among Us for significant
                motives.
              </li>
              <li>
                Even though the game was made back in 2018, it only became
                popular with major new updates in 2020. The popularity was due
                to Twitch streamers, especially Korean ones.
              </li>
              <li>
                On some platforms, the icon for Among Us was changed in version
                2021.6.15 to match the altered art style.
