        <p> Maps are a core mechanic of Among Us that make up the environment that players move in and interact with. 
            The map played on is chosen before a game starts, with each one containing unique features, locations, and 
            tasks.</p>
            
        <h1 id="Overview">Overview</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> Each map is made up of many different locations and hallways connecting them. Most locations in Among Us 
            contain different tasks and abilities, such as Doorlog. Each map is released separately from the others, 
            each releasing new tasks, locations, abilities, and cosmetics.<br>

            <br>The map played on is selected before the game starts. In online games, the map is chosen on a screen that 
            appears before the host enters the lobby, along with the number of Impostors and maximum players. In local 
            games, the map is selected via customize in the lobby. In Freeplay, the map is selected via a pop-up menu 
            when the mode is selected.</p>
