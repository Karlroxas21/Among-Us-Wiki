        <p> Locations in Among Us each have a specific usage. On The Skeld, Polus, and The Airship, entering most locations is only possible when 
            the doors in the location are not Sabotaged. Living Impostors may use vents to quickly travel to many locations, such as Admin.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>Locations are a very important mechanic in Among Us. Locations sometimes make a perfect environment to kill Crewmates, such as 
            Electrical on The Skeld, largely known for the large amount of kills that take place in the latter. A vast majority of locations 
            also contain tasks.</p><br><br>
