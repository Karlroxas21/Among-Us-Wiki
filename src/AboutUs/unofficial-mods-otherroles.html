                  <h3 id="evilmini">Evil Mini</h3>
                  <p>The Mini's character is smaller and hence visible to everyone in the game. The Mini cannot be killed until it turns 18 years old, however it can be voted out. While growing up the kill cooldown is doubled. When it's fully grown up its kill cooldown is 2/3 of the default one. If it gets thrown out of the ship, everything is fine.</p>

                  <h3 id="evilguesser">Evil Guesser</h3>
                  <p>The Guesser can shoot players during the meeting, by guessing its role. If the guess is wrong, the Guesser dies instead. The host can select how many players can be shot per game and if multiple players can be shot during a single meeting. The guesses Impostor and Crewmate are only right, if the player is part of the corresponding team and has no special role. They can only shoot during the voting time. Depending on the options, the Guesser can't guess the shielded player and depending on the Medic options the Medic/shielded player might be notified (no one will die, independently of what the Guesser guessed).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="roles">
                  <h3 id="bountyhunter">Bounty Hunter</h3>
                  <p>The Bounty Hunter is an Impostor, that continuously get bounties (the targeted player doesn't get notified). The target of the Bounty Hunter swaps after every meeting and after a configurable amount of time. If the Bounty Hunter kills their target, their kill cooldown will be a lot less than usual. Killing a player that's not their current target results in an increased kill cooldown. Depending on the options, there'll be an arrow pointing towards the current target.</p>

                <div class="roles">
                  <h3 id="camouflager">Camouflager</h3>
                  <p>The Camouflager is an Impostor which can additionally activate a camouflage mode. The camouflage mode lasts for 10s and while it is active, all player names/pets/hats are hidden and all players have the same color.</p>

                  <h3 id="eraser">Eraser</h3>
                  <p>The Eraser is an Impostor that can erase the role of every player. The targeted players will lose their role after the meeting right before a player is exiled. After every erase, the cooldown increases by 10 seconds. The erase will be performed, even if the Eraser or their target die before the next meeting. By default the Eraser can erase everyone but the Spy and other Impostors. Depending on the options they can also erase them (Impostors will lose their special Impostor ability).</p>

                  <h3 id="morphling">Morphling</h3>
                  <p>The Morphling is an Impostor which can additionally scan the appearance of a player. After an arbitrary time they can take on that appearance for 10 seconds.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="roles">
                  <h3 id="trickster">Trickster</h3>
                  <p>The Trickster is an Impostor that can place 3 jack-in-the-boxes that are invisible at first to other players. If the Trickster has placed all of their boxes they will be converted into a vent network usable only by the Trickster themself, but the boxes are revealed to the others. If the boxes are converted to a vent network, the Trickster gains a new ability "Lights out" to limit the visibility of Non-Impostors, that cannot be fixed by other players. Lights are automatically restored after a while.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="roles">
                  <h3 id="vampire">Vampire</h3>
                  <p>The Vampire is an Impostor, that can bite other player. Bitten players die after a configurable amount of time. If the Vampire spawn chance is greater 0 (even if there is no Vampire in the game), all players can place one garlic. If a victim is near a garlic, the "Bite Button" turns into the default "Kill Button" and the Vampire can only perform a normal kill.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="roles">
                  <h3 id="warlock">Warlock</h3>
                  <p>The Warlock is an Impostor, that can curse another player (the cursed player doesn't get notified). If the cursed person stands next to another player, the Warlock is able to kill that player (no matter how far away they are). Performing a kill with the help of a cursed player, will lift the curse and it will result in the Warlock being unable to move for a configurable amount of time. The Warlock can still perform normal kills, but the two buttons share the same cooldown.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="roles">
                  <h3 id="witch">Witch</h3>
                  <p>The Witch is an Impostor who has the ability to cast a spell on other players. During the next meeting, the spellbound player will be highlighted and they'll die right after the meeting. There are multiple options listed down below with which you can configure to fit your taste. Similar to the Vampire, shields and blanks will be checked twice (at the end of casting the spell on the player and at the end of the meeting, when the spell will be activated). This can result in players being marked as spelled during the meeting, but not dying in the end (when they get a shield or the Witch gets blanked after they were spelled by the Witch). If the Witch dies before the meeting starts or if the Witch is being guessed during the meeting, the spellbound players will be highlighted but they'll survive in any case. Depending on the options you can choose whether voting the Witch out will save all the spellbound players or not.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="roles">

                  <h3 id="nicemini">Nice Mini</h3>
                  <p>The Mini's character is smaller and hence visible to everyone in the game. The Mini cannot be killed until it turns 18 years old, however it can be voted out. The Crewmate Mini aims to play out the strength its invincibility in the early game. If it gets thrown out of the ship before it turns 18, everyone loses. So think twice before voting out a Mini.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="roles">
                  <h3 id="niceguesser">Nice Guesser</h3>
                  <p>The Guesser can shoot players during the meeting, by guessing its role. If the guess is wrong, the Guesser dies instead. The host can select how many players can be shot per game and if multiple players can be shot during a single meeting.

The Shift will always be performed at the end of the next meeting right before a player is exiled. The target needs to be chosen during the round. Even if the Shifter or the target dies before the meeting, the Shift will still be performed. Swapping roles with an Impostor or Neutral fails and the Shifter commits suicide after the next meeting (there won't be any body). The Shifter aims to save roles from leaving the game, by e.g. taking over a Sheriff or Medic that is known to the Impostors. This works especially well against the Eraser, but also gives the Eraser the possibility to act like a Shifter. The special interactions with the Shifter are noted in the chapters of the respective roles.</p>

The Sidekick loses their current role (except if they're a Lover, then they play in two teams). The "Create Sidekick Action" may only be used once per Jackal or once per game (depending on the options). The Jackal can also promote Impostors to be their Sidekick but, depending on the options the Impostor will either really turn into the Sidekick and leave the team Impostors or they will just look like the Sidekick to the Jackal and remain as they were.</p>

If their client dies or gets voted out, the Lawyer changes their role and becomes the Pursuer, which has a different goal to win the game. The main goal of the Lawyer is to win as Lawyer, as it is not allowed to betray their client. <br>
                  
                    The Lawyer can win in multiple ways: <br>

The client doesn't win (even if their Impostor/Team Jackal mate wins), the Lawyer steals their win. Hence the client should keep the Lawyer alive for some time, to get some help during the meetings, but has to eliminate them soon enough to not get their win stolen.</li>

In order to achieve this goal, the Pursuer has the ability "Blank": they can fill a killer's (this also includes the Sheriff's) weapon with a blank, so if the killer attempts to kill someone, the killer will miss the target and all cooldowns will be triggered as usual. If the killer blanks, no shields (e.g. Medic shield or Time Master shield) will be triggered. The Pursuer has tasks (which can already be done while being a Lawyer), that count towards the task win for the Crewmates. If the Pursuer dies, their tasks won't be counted anymore.</p>

                  <p>There are always two Lovers which are linked together. Their primary goal is it to stay alive together until the end of the game. If one Lover dies (and the option is activated), the other Lover suicides. You can select if Lovers are able to have a second role (could be a Neutral, Crewmate or Impostor Role) You can specify the chance of one Lover being an Impostor. The Lovers never know the role of their partner, they only see who their partner is. The Lovers win, if they are both alive when the game ends. They can also win with their original team (e.g. a dead Impostor Lover can win with the Impostors, an Arsonist Lover can still achieve an Arsonist win) If one of the Lovers is a killer (i.e. Jackal/Sidekick/Impostor), they can achieve a "Lovers solo win" where only the Lovers win. If there is no killer among the Lovers (e.g. an Arsonist Lover + Crewmate Lover) and they are both alive when the game ends, they win together with the Crewmates. If there's a team Impostor/Jackal Lover in the game, the tasks of a Crewmate Lover won't be counted (for a task win) as long as they're alive. If the Lover dies, their tasks will also be counted.</p>
